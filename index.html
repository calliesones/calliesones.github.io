<!-- Day 31 Intro to html -- make a webpage -->
<!-- This is a comment, in between these two sets of symbols -->

<!-- html is hypertext markup language -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- every webpage starts with the above line -->
<!-- html includes tags
	an <opening-tag> inside of angle bracket
    and usually a </closing-tag> -- also has a slash after the opening bracket -->

<html>
	<head>	<!-- The head section is meta-data about your web page -->
		<title>My First Web Page</title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
	</head>
	<body bgcolor="#9cece5">	<!-- This is where the content of your web page goes -->
		<!-- Change the background color of this page using a HEX color. Ctl-Shift-P
		 then type 'color picker' -->

		<!-- Now, let's add a large centered headline -->
		<h1>All About Me</h1>

		<!-- Let's put some text in a paragraph -->
		<p>My name is Callie and I am an International Affairs and Modern Languages (French) major at GT. I studied abroad last semester in Metz, France. I work at a theater and I love watching and analyzing new tv shows - like The Pitt!</p>

		<!-- the headline goes from h1 (largest) down to h6 (smallest). -->
		<!-- medium headline -->
		<h3> Picture of Me!</h3>

		<!-- Add an image of yourself to your web page.  -->
		<img src="Me.jpeg">
		<!-- src is an attribute and its value is "buzz1.jpg"
		 Be sure to put your image files in the same folder as index.html -->

		<p>I am a part of French club as well as French honor society.<br>You might see me at the CRC often! I like working out.</p>
		<!-- Note that <br> does NOT have a closing tag unlike most other tags -->

		<!-- let's add a link to another page -->
		<!-- the link tag is <a> and the attribute for the webpage is href -->

		<p>
		My favorite extracurricular activity is watching tv lol.<br>
		To learn all about my favorite show go to this website: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pitt">The Pitt</a>. Everything you need to know is there.
		</p>

		<!-- How do I make a webpage open in a new tab?
			use the target attribute, with the value "_blank" -->
		<p> Open The Pitt in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pitt" target="_blank">new tab</a>.</p>

		<!-- Can we make an image be a weblink?
			Yes, just put an <img> inside of the <a> tag instead of text. -->
		<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/03/17/the-best-show-on-tv-has-to-be-the-pitt-right/"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3MDliMGEtMDQxNi00OTk1LTg1NWMtZDM2NmEwZDA1ZDk2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg" alt="The Pitt. Click for home."></a></p>

		<!-- Can we link a YouTube video?

		<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ufR_08V38sQ?si=Eelyx_VROi5M_DpA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

		<!-- Add a bullet list -->
		<!-- this is called an unordered list, <ul>
			and every line in the bullet list is a list item, <li> 
		-->

		-->

			<li>Bananas</li>
		</ol>

		<!-- Add a 3x3 table -->
		<!-- Tables - grids of rows and columns
			Tags are:
			<table>
				<th> -- optional, a table header, used for the top row
				<tr> -- a table row
				<td> -- a table data (column in a row)
		-->
		<table>
